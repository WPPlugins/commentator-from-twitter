== Description ==

The plugin «Commentator from Twitter» helps to allocate visually commentators who have specified in the field «Web site» the link to Twitter.

The technical information:
The plugin works with two standard functions, various generation. With comment_author_link 
(till now popular way to deduce the comment) and with wp_comment_list 
(thanks to remarkable return compatibility WordPress).

If at you comments are deduced through random function which is defined through plugins — 
the plugin «Commentator from Twitter» will work that almost for certain if through functions.php 
your template — that almost for certain doesn’t work. If you use any of two functions 
written above all should work. If won’t work — write bug reports, please.

And as usually. The plug-in works by principle «As is».
